    <h1 id="job-fraud">💼 Job Fraud</h1>
    <h2>🔍 What is Job Fraud?</h2>
    <p>Job fraud scams promise attractive jobs with high salaries, flexible work, or overseas opportunities — but their real aim is to steal your money or personal data. Scammers may send fake offer letters, ask for “registration fees,” or collect sensitive details like Aadhaar or bank info.</p>
    <h2>⚠️ Common Signs to Watch For:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Asking for money upfront (training fee, registration fee, processing fee)</li>
        <li>Offers that come without interviews or skill checks</li>
        <li>Emails sent from free services like Gmail, not official company domains</li>
        <li>Job ads that sound “too good to be true”</li>
        <li>Urgent deadlines: “Pay now to reserve your spot”</li>
        <li>Poor grammar or generic greetings like “Dear Candidate”</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>📚 Real Example:</h2>
    <p>Priya, a final-year student, was actively looking for part-time work to help her family. One afternoon, she got a WhatsApp message from an unknown number claiming to be an HR manager at a popular company. The message looked professional, with a logo and a link to a fake website that looked almost real. The so-called HR manager told Priya that she was “pre-selected” for a remote data entry job that paid ₹30,000 per month. To secure the job, he asked her to pay a ₹1,200 “registration fee” immediately, saying there were many applicants and only quick responders would be hired. Wanting to help her family, Priya quickly transferred the money through UPI. After the payment, the HR stopped replying to her messages. Later, the phone number was switched off, and when she checked the company's official website, she realized there was no such job opening listed. Priya felt embarrassed and worried because she had shared her resume, address, and phone number. Luckily, she did not share her Aadhaar or bank account details, but the scam cost her money and trust — and made her more careful in the future.</p>
    <h2>🛡 How to Protect Yourself:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Never pay to get a job — real employers don’t ask for money.</li>
        <li>Research the company on their <strong>official website</strong> or call them directly.</li>
        <li>Check if the email is from a company domain (e.g., hr@company.com).</li>
        <li>Ask detailed questions; scammers avoid specifics.</li>
        <li>Trust your instincts — if something feels suspicious, stop and verify.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>📝 If You’ve Been Scammed:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Stop all contact with the scammer.</li>
        <li>Save all chats, receipts, screenshots, and emails as evidence.</li>
        <li>Report the fraud to your local cyber crime cell or <a href="https://cybercrime.gov.in/" target="_blank">cybercrime.gov.in</a>.</li>
        <li>Share your experience with others to warn them.</li>

    <h1 id="romance-fraud">❤️ Romance Fraud</h1>
    <h2>🔍 What is Romance Fraud?</h2>
    <p>Romance scams happen when someone builds a fake relationship online to gain trust and affection, then asks for money or gifts using emotional stories.</p>
    <h2>⚠️ Common Signs to Watch For:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>They avoid video calls or meeting in person</li>
        <li>Move conversations quickly to private chat apps</li>
        <li>Say they are overseas or working abroad</li>
        <li>Ask for money urgently due to “emergencies”</li>
        <li>Too many compliments and strong feelings too soon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>📚 Real Example:</h2>
    <p>Asha, a college student, connected on Instagram with someone calling himself Rahul, who claimed to be an Indian engineer working in Dubai. Rahul was friendly, charming, and messaged her every morning and night. Over weeks, he slowly built trust — sending selfies, sharing stories about missing family, and calling her "special." After two months, Rahul told Asha he planned to visit India, but had an unexpected problem: his company account was "temporarily frozen." He asked if she could urgently transfer ₹20,000 so he wouldn't miss the flight. Because she felt emotionally close to him, Asha sent the money via UPI. Days passed, Rahul made excuses: lost phone, meetings, customs issues. He then asked for another ₹15,000 to “unlock luggage stuck at the airport.” Feeling uneasy, Asha reverse-searched Rahul's photos on Google — and found they belonged to a European model. Realizing she’d been scammed, she blocked him immediately. Asha felt deeply embarrassed and sad, not just for losing money, but for being emotionally betrayed. She later warned her friends to be careful with people met online.</p>
    <h2>🛡 How to Protect Yourself:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Be careful with people who move too fast emotionally</li>
        <li>Never send money to someone you haven’t met in person</li>
        <li>Check their photos by doing a reverse image search</li>
        <li>Talk to friends/family if you feel pressured</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>📝 If You’ve Been Scammed:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Stop all contact immediately</li>
        <li>Keep chat screenshots and receipts</li>
        <li>Report to <a href="https://cybercrime.gov.in/" target="_blank">cybercrime.gov.in</a></li>

    <h1 id="crypto-betting-scams">🪙 Crypto / Betting Scams</h1>
    <h2>🔍 What is Crypto / Betting Scam?</h2>
    <p>Fraudsters promise high profits or big bonuses by investing in crypto or betting apps. They show fake profits, then disappear with your money.</p>
    <h2>⚠️ Common Signs to Watch For:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Guaranteed profits or no risk claims</li>
        <li>Fake screenshots of high earnings</li>
        <li>Pressure to invest quickly</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>📚 Real Example:</h2>
    <p>Karan, a college student, joined a Telegram group promising to double crypto investments in 24 hours. The admin shared daily screenshots of huge profits and claimed they had a “special method.” Karan trusted them and sent ₹5,000 in crypto. The admin quickly showed him a fake "account screenshot" with ₹10,000 balance — but said Karan had to pay ₹2,000 more as a "withdrawal fee" to get the money. Sensing something wrong, Karan refused. The admin threatened to block him and called him “unprofessional.” Moments later, Karan was removed from the group and couldn’t contact anyone. Karan lost the ₹5,000 he sent, but was glad he didn’t send more. He now understands that offers guaranteeing quick double returns are nearly always scams.</p>
    <h2>🛡 How to Protect Yourself:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Be careful with anyone promising guaranteed profits</li>
        <li>Don’t invest money you can’t afford to lose</li>
        <li>Check for SEBI or regulatory approval (for financial products)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>📝 If You’ve Been Scammed:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Save all chats, payments, and screenshots</li>
        <li>Report to <a href="https://cybercrime.gov.in/" target="_blank">cybercrime.gov.in</a></li>

    <h1 id="fake-loan-offers">💸 Fake Loan Offers</h1>
    <h2>🔍 What is Fake Loan Scam?</h2>
    <p>Scammers offer easy loans without documents but ask for an advance “processing fee.” After payment, they vanish without giving the loan.</p>
    <h2>⚠️ Common Signs to Watch For:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No income verification</li>
        <li>Promise of very fast approval</li>
        <li>Asking for advance fee via UPI</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>📚 Real Example:</h2>
    <p>Arun, a young professional, saw an ad on Facebook promising instant loans of up to ₹1 lakh without documents, even for people with low credit scores. Excited, he contacted the number via WhatsApp. The "loan officer" was polite and sent fake but official-looking PDF documents. The officer told Arun his loan was approved, but he had to pay a ₹2,500 "processing fee" first. Arun paid through UPI. Moments later, the officer said there was a “tax clearance” fee of another ₹3,000. When Arun hesitated, the officer warned the loan offer would expire. Feeling pressured, Arun paid again. After that, the officer stopped replying, blocked Arun, and the number disappeared from WhatsApp. Arun realized it was a scam. He lost ₹5,500, but thankfully didn't share Aadhaar or bank login details. He reported the fraud to the cyber crime portal to warn others.</p>
    <h2>🛡 How to Protect Yourself:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Never pay money upfront for loans</li>
        <li>Check company registration and reviews</li>
        <li>Use only RBI registered lenders</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>📝 If You’ve Been Scammed:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Save chats and receipts</li>
        <li>File complaint at <a href="https://cybercrime.gov.in/" target="_blank">cybercrime.gov.in</a></li>

    <h1 id="network-scams">📶 Network Scams</h1>
    <h2>🔍 What is Network Scam?</h2>
    <p>Scammers use fake Wi‑Fi hotspots, suspicious downloads, or malware links to steal your data or install spyware on your devices.</p>
    <h2>⚠️ Common Signs to Watch For:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Free public Wi‑Fi with unknown names</li>
        <li>Links in emails/texts asking to download apps</li>
        <li>Pop-ups claiming your device is infected</li>

    <h2>📚 Real Example:</h2>
    <p>Vikram, a freelance graphic designer, visited a cafe to work. He connected to a Wi‑Fi network called "Cafe_Free_WiFi" that didn’t ask for a password. Soon after, he noticed his laptop ran slower and showed pop‑ups. Later that night, he received bank alerts about login attempts he hadn’t made. Alarmed, Vikram immediately logged in to change his passwords. A security expert later told him the free Wi‑Fi was fake — created by scammers to capture login details and cookies. Vikram learned the risk the hard way: even simple Browse can give hackers access if the network is fake. Since then, he only uses trusted networks and keeps a VPN active to protect personal data.</p>
